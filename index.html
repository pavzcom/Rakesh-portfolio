        With over 25 years of experience in Sales and Marketing—including more than 20 years specializing in marketing—I’ve had the privilege of working with some of the leading corporate giants, particularly within the telecom industry. Throughout my career, I’ve built a strong track record in driving sales and marketing strategies, spearheading strategic planning initiatives, developing markets, and revamping business operations to achieve sustainable growth.

        <br><br>My professional journey has equipped me with deep expertise in P&L management, alliance partnerships, and team leadership. These skills have been instrumental in shaping the strategic direction and growth of Adreone, where I currently play a pivotal role.

        <br><br>Having collaborated with top-tier players in both corporate and telecom sectors, I’ve developed the agility to navigate fast-changing business environments and consistently deliver impactful results. I believe in a hands-on, relationship-driven approach to leadership—one that combines strategic vision with operational precision.

        <br><br>Known for being adaptable, detail-oriented, and results-focused, I take pride in aligning teams around a shared purpose and turning ambitious goals into tangible achievements. My mission is always to deliver value that transforms organizations from within.
